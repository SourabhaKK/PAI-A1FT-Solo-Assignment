Software Engineering: Software Requirements
Analysis
@overview
In this module, you will learn how to understand, capture, analyse, document,
and prioritise software requirements. Y ou will explore why requirements are
central to successful projects, how to work with stakeholders to discover what
they really need, and how to structure and prioritise those needs using frame-
works such as FURPS+ and MoSCoW. By the end of this module, you will be
able to produce a well-organised, high‑quality set of requirements for a software
system.
Lesson Preparation
F or this lesson, it is helpful (but not essential) to have:
• A simple example system in mind (e.g. an online library , a mobile banking
app, or an AI‑based recommendation system).
• Some experience working in or observing a software project (e.g. course-
work, internship, or hobby project).
• Pen and paper or a text editor to draft your own requirements.
1. Introduction: What Are Software Requirements?
Software requirements describe what a system should do and the constraints
under which it must operate. They capture the needs of customers, users, regu-
lators, and other stakeholders in a way that both business and technical people
can understand.
• A requirement is a statement about a needed capability , behaviour, qual-
ity , or constraint.
• Requirements form the basis for design, implementation, testing, and
acceptance.
• Poor or missing requirements are a major cause of project failure (overruns,
rework, unhappy users).
1.1 Goals, Requirements, and Design
It is useful to distinguish between:
• Business goals : High-level outcomes the organisation wants (e.g. “Re-
duce manual processing time by 50%”).
1• Requirements: Observable capabilities that support those goals
(e.g. “The system shall automatically classify incoming requests within
10 seconds”).
• Design decisions : How the system is built to satisfy requirements
(e.g. “Use a microservice architecture with a message queue”).
In requirements analysis, we focus mainly on the requirements layer: mak-
ing sure we understand the problem and desired behaviour before diving into
technical solutions.
2. The Role of Requirements in the SDLC
Requirements sit near the beginning of the software development lifecycle
(SDLC), but they influence all later stages:
• Planning: Estimation and scheduling rely on understanding what needs
to be built.
• Architecture and design : The system structure must support the re-
quired behaviour and qualities.
• Implementation: Developers need clear, unambiguous requirements to
implement correctly .
• T esting: T est cases are derived from requirements (especially functional
and non-functional).
• Deployment and maintenance : Requirements guide roll‑out, user
training, and future enhancements.
Both plan‑driven (e.g. waterfall) and agile approaches depend on require-
ments:
• In waterfall, requirements are often documented in a detailed Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) early in the project.
• In agile, requirements are expressed more flexibly as user stories and
evolve iteratively , but the need for clarity , prioritisation, and traceability
remains.
3. Types of Requirements
Requirements can be categorised in several ways. T wo of the most important
categories are:
• F unctional Requirements (FRs)
• Non-functional Requirements (NFRs) (also called quality attributes)
23.1 F unctional Requirements
F unctional requirements describe the behaviours, services, and functions
the system must provide.
• They define how the system should react to inputs and how it should
behave in particular situations.
• They can often be expressed as “The system shall …” .
Examples (Online Library System)
• FR1: The system shall allow registered users to search for books by title,
author, or ISBN.
• FR2: The system shall allow librarians to add new books to the catalogue.
• FR3: The system shall send an email reminder to users 3 days before a
book is due.
3.2 Non-functional Requirements (NFRs)
Non-functional requirements describe qualities of the system and constraints
on how it is built or operated.
• They influence user satisfaction, robustness, performance, and maintain-
ability .
• They can be more diﬀicult to discover and articulate, but are just as
important as functional requirements.
Common NFR categories include:
• Performance (e.g. response time, throughput)
• Reliability and availability
• Security and privacy
• Usability and accessibility
• Maintainability and supportability
• Portability
• Legal and regulatory compliance
Later in this module, we will structure these systematically using
the FURPS+ model.
3.3 Other Requirement Categories
Y ou may also encounter:
• User requirements : High-level statements of what users need (often in
natural language).
• System requirements : Detailed descriptions of system functions and
constraints; more technical.
• Domain requirements : Requirements arising from the specific applica-
tion domain (e.g. medical, finance, aerospace).
3• Interface requirements: Requirements about interactions with external
systems, devices, or APIs.
4. The Requirements Engineering Process
Requirements engineering is a process, not a single step. A common high‑level
process is:
1. Elicitation
2. Analysis and negotiation
3. Specification
4. V alidation
5. Management (and change control)
4.1 Elicitation
Elicitation is about discovering requirements:
• Understand the problem domain and business context.
• Identify stakeholders and their goals.
• Gather initial requirements via interviews, workshops, observation, etc.
(see Section 5).
Outputs: initial list of goals, requirements, constraints, and assumptions.
4.2 Analysis and Negotiation
Analysis refines raw requirements into a consistent, complete, and feasible set:
• Identify and resolve conflicts between stakeholder needs.
• Detect overlaps, duplicates, and gaps.
• Clarify ambiguous statements.
• Prioritise requirements (e.g. with MoSCoW).
• Check feasibility against budget, technology , time.
Outputs: structured and prioritised requirements, trade‑offs agreed with stake-
holders.
4.3 Specification
Specification is about documenting requirements clearly and in a form that can
be used by designers, developers, and testers:
• Natural language requirements (often numbered lists).
• Use cases, user stories, scenarios.
• Diagrams (e.g. UML: use case, activity , state, sequence diagrams).
• Models (e.g. data models, domain models).
4Outputs: a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) or equivalent
backlog of well‑defined requirements.
4.4 V alidation
V alidation checks whether the requirements are correct and complete :
• Do they reflect what stakeholders really want?
• Are there missing or conflicting requirements?
• Are they testable and realistic?
Common validation techniques:
• Reviews and inspections.
• Prototyping and mock‑ups.
• W alkthroughs with users.
• T est case derivation to check testability .
4.5 Management and Change Control
Requirements are not static. As the project progresses, requirements may
change because:
• Stakeholders better understand their needs.
• Regulations change.
• New technology becomes available.
• Constraints (budget, time) shift.
Requirements management includes:
• V ersioning and baselining requirements.
• T racking changes and their impact.
• Maintaining traceability (e.g. linking requirements to design, code, and
tests).
• Communicating changes to the team.
5. Stakeholders and Elicitation T echniques
5.1 Identifying Stakeholders
Stakeholders are people or organisations who have an interest in the system:
• End users (different user roles).
• Customers and sponsors.
• Business owners and managers.
• Operations and support teams.
• Regulators and auditors.
• Other systems or teams that integrate with your system.
5Missing important stakeholder groups is a common cause of late surprises and
rework.
5.2 Common Elicitation T echniques
Different techniques suit different contexts. Often, a mix is best.
• Interviews
– One‑to‑one or small groups.
– Use open questions (“How do you do this task today?”) and closed
questions (“Do you need this daily or weekly?”).
– Good for deep understanding and exploring tacit knowledge.
• W orkshops and focus groups
– Bring multiple stakeholders together.
– Good for identifying conflicts, negotiating priorities, and building
shared understanding.
– T echniques: brainstorming, storyboarding, collaborative sketching.
• Observation (shadowing)
– W atch users performing their tasks in real environments.
– Reveals workarounds and real constraints that people may not men-
tion in interviews.
• Document analysis
– Examine existing forms, procedures, reports, regulations, legacy sys-
tems.
– Useful for understanding current processes and constraints.
• Questionnaires and surveys
– Eﬀicient for large stakeholder groups.
– Best for quantifiable questions (e.g. “How often do you use feature
X?”).
• Prototyping
– Build simple mock‑ups or interactive prototypes.
– Helps stakeholders understand and refine requirements, especially
UI/UX.
In AI projects, prototypes are often used to explore model behaviour
with real data, revealing new functional and non-functional require-
ments (e.g. explainability , fairness).
6. Documenting Requirements
6.1 Natural Language Requirements
Natural language is widely used because it is accessible to non‑technical stake-
holders. T o avoid ambiguity:
• Use consistent templates , such as:
6– “The system shall <do something> <under condition>. ”
• A void vague terms like “user‑friendly”, “fast”, “secure” without quantifi-
cation.
• Use active voice and clear subjects:
– Prefer: “The system shall log every failed login attempt. ”
– A void: “Every failed login attempt will be logged. ”
Example (Ambiguous vs. Improved)
• Ambiguous: “The system should be fast. ”
• Improved: “The system shall display search results within 2 seconds for
95% of queries under normal load. ”
6.2 Use Cases
A use case describes a sequence of interactions between an actor (user or ex-
ternal system) and the system to achieve a goal.
Typical elements:
• Use case name and ID.
• Primary actor.
• Goal.
• Preconditions and postconditions.
• Main success scenario.
• Alternative and exception flows.
Example (Simplified Use Case)
• Use Case ID: UC1
• Name: Borrow Book
• Actor: Registered User
• Goal: Borrow a book from the online library .
• Main steps:
1. User searches for a book.
2. System displays matching books.
3. User selects a book and clicks “Borrow” .
4. System checks availability .
5. System reserves the book and confirms to the user.
F rom this use case, we can derive multiple functional requirements and test
cases.
6.3 User Stories and Acceptance Criteria (Agile)
In agile contexts, requirements are often expressed as user stories :
• T emplate: “As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some
benefit>. ”
7User stories should be accompanied by acceptance criteria that specify when
the story is considered done.
Example
• User Story:
As a registered user, I want to receive email reminders before my
books are due so that I avoid late fees .
• Acceptance Criteria:
– The system sends a reminder email 3 days before the due date.
– If a book is renewed, the reminder schedule is updated.
– Users can opt out of reminder emails in their profile settings.
Good user stories are often described by the INVEST properties: - Indepen-
dent, Negotiable, V aluable, Estimable, Small, T estable.
7. Qualities of Good Requirements
High‑quality requirements share several properties:
• Correct: Reflect real stakeholder needs.
• Complete: Cover all significant situations and constraints (within scope).
• Consistent: No conflicts between requirements.
• Unambiguous: Interpreted the same way by different readers.
• V erifiable: There is a clear way to test whether the requirement is satis-
fied.
• F easible: Achievable within technical, budget, and time constraints.
• Prioritised: Relative importance is clear (e.g. using MoSCoW).
Example (Improving V erifiability)
• V ague: “The interface shall be intuitive. ”
• V erifiable: “New users shall be able to complete the registration process
without external help within 3 minutes in 90% of usability test sessions. ”
8. The FURPS+ Model
The FURPS+ model is a way to structure non-functional requirements and
certain constraints. It was introduced by Hewlett-Packard and is widely used
in software engineering.
FURPS stands for:
• Functionality
• Usability
• Reliability
8• Performance
• Supportability
The + refers to additional categories such as implementation, interface, op-
erations, packaging, legal, etc.
8.1 FURPS+ Overview
Category Description Example (Online Library)
F unctionality F eatures, capabilities, security ,
business rules
Role-based access control,
recommendation engine
Usability Human factors, UI, help,
documentation
Consistent navigation,
accessibility for screen readers
Reliability A vailability , fault tolerance,
recoverability
99.5% uptime, automatic
recovery from server failure
Performance Response time, throughput,
resource usage
Search results within 2 seconds,
supports 500 users online
Supportability T estability , maintainability ,
configurability , extensibility
Modular architecture,
configuration via admin UI
+ (Plus) Implementation, interfaces,
operations, packaging, legal
Must run on Linux, GDPR
compliance, REST API for
partners
8.2 F – F unctionality
F unctionality includes:
• F eature sets and capabilities.
• Security requirements (authentication, authorisation, auditing).
• Business rules and domain‑specific logic.
Examples
• The system shall enforce role‑based access control (user, librarian, admin).
• The system shall log all book borrow and return operations for 2 years.
• The recommendation engine shall suggest at least 5 books based on the
user’s borrowing history .
8.3 U – Usability
Usability captures how easy and pleasant the system is to use:
• User interface design and consistency .
• Learnability and discoverability .
• Accessibility (e.g. WCAG compliance).
• Help, tutorials, and documentation.
Examples
9• First‑time users shall be able to search and borrow a book without train-
ing.
• The system shall support keyboard navigation and screen readers.
• An online help guide shall be available from every page.
8.4 R – Reliability
Reliability is about the system’s ability to operate correctly over time:
• A vailability (uptime).
• Mean time between failures (MTBF).
• Error rates and fault tolerance.
• Backup and recovery strategies.
Examples
• The system shall have at least 99.5% availability during opening hours.
• No more than 1 in 10,000 transactions shall be lost due to system errors.
• In case of server failure, the system shall recover within 5 minutes without
data loss.
8.5 P – Performance
Performance covers response times, throughput, and resource usage:
• How quickly the system responds to actions.
• How many concurrent users or transactions it can handle.
• Resource consumption (CPU, memory , network).
Examples
• Search queries shall return results within 2 seconds for 95% of requests
under normal load.
• The system shall support at least 500 concurrent users browsing the cata-
logue.
• Generating a monthly usage report shall take no more than 30 seconds.
8.6 S – Supportability
Supportability relates to how easily the system can be maintained, tested, and
extended:
• Modularity and code quality .
• Configurability (without code changes).
• Diagnostics and logging.
• Internationalisation and localisation.
Examples
• Configuration of email server settings shall be possible via an admin UI,
without code changes.
10• The system shall provide logs with timestamps and correlation IDs for all
API requests.
• Adding a new language shall require only translation of external resource
files.
8.7 The “+” in FURPS+
The plus part covers additional constraints:
• Implementation: T echnology stack, programming languages, frame-
works.
– Example: The backend shall be implemented in Python and run on
Linux servers.
• Interfaces: Interfaces to other systems, hardware, or devices.
– Example: The system shall expose a RESTful API for integration
with external catalogues.
• Operations: Operational and deployment constraints.
– Example: The system shall support rolling updates with zero down-
time.
• Packaging: How the system is delivered.
– Example: The system shall be deployable as Docker containers.
• Legal / Licensing / Regulatory :
– Example: The system shall comply with GDPR for all EU users.
FURPS+ helps ensure that important non‑functional and constraint
areas are not forgotten. During analysis, you can use FURPS+ as a
checklist.
8.8 FURPS+ Example: Online Course Platform
Consider an online course platform (similar to an LMS):
• F unctionality
– The system shall allow instructors to create and publish courses.
– The system shall allow students to enrol, track progress, and receive
completion certificates.
– The system shall integrate with payment providers for paid courses.
• Usability
– The platform shall be accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
– The UI shall support dark mode and standard keyboard shortcuts.
– A tutorial course shall be available to new users.
• Reliability
– The platform shall achieve 99.8% uptime.
– No single user data loss is acceptable due to system failures.
– Daily backups shall be taken and retained for 30 days.
• Performance
– Course pages shall load within 3 seconds for 95% of page views.
– The system shall handle 2,000 concurrent learners watching videos.
11– Video playback shall adapt automatically to network bandwidth.
• Supportability
– Instructors shall be able to duplicate a course to create a new version.
– System logs shall be searchable by course ID and user ID.
– Admins shall be able to toggle features (e.g. comments) in configura-
tion.
• + (Implementation / Interfaces / Legal)
– The platform shall support single sign‑on (SSO) with the university’s
identity provider.
– The platform shall comply with GDPR and store data in EU‑based
data centres.
– The system shall expose APIs for exporting course completion data
to external analytics tools.
9. MoSCoW Prioritisation
MoSCoW is a widely used technique for prioritising requirements, especially
in agile and time‑boxed projects.
MoSCoW stands for:
• Must have
• Should have
• Could have
• Won’t have (this time)
9.1 Categories
• Must have
– Essential for a viable solution.
– Without these, the system is not acceptable.
– Often related to core business needs, safety , or legal requirements.
• Should have
– Important but not vital.
– W orkarounds may exist, but they are often inconvenient.
• Could have
– Desirable but not necessary .
– Provide nice‑to‑have improvements or enhancements.
– Usually implemented if time and budget allow.
• W on’t have (this time)
– Explicitly out of scope for the current release.
– May be revisited in future versions.
– Helps manage expectations and avoid scope creep.
129.2 Applying MoSCoW: Steps
1. List all candidate requirements (functional, non-functional, con-
straints).
2. Discuss with stakeholders :
• What is absolutely essential for success?
• What can be deferred or replaced with workarounds?
3. Assign each requirement to one of the four categories.
4. Review for balance :
• If almost everything is marked “Must”, challenge and renegotiate.
5. Revisit regularly :
• Priorities may evolve as more is learned.
9.3 Example: Online Library System
Suppose we have the following requirements:
1. Users can search the catalogue.
2. Users can borrow and return books.
3. Librarians can add and remove books.
4. Users receive email reminders before due dates.
5. Users can rate and review books.
6. The system supports dark mode.
7. The system integrates with an external university database.
8. The system supports multilingual user interfaces.
A possible MoSCoW classification for the first release :
• Must have
– R1: Users can search the catalogue.
– R2: Users can borrow and return books.
– R3: Librarians can add and remove books.
– R7: The system integrates with the external university database.
• Should have
– R4: Users receive email reminders before due dates.
– R8: The system supports multilingual user interfaces.
• Could have
– R5: Users can rate and review books.
– R6: The system supports dark mode.
• W on’t have (this time)
– Any additional social features (e.g. following other users) that are
nice but not currently planned.
Combining MoSCoW with FURPS+ can help ensure that both func-
tional and non‑functional requirements are prioritised appropriately .
1310. Case Study: AI‑Based Recommendation System
T o connect this to AI‑related systems, consider an AI‑based recommenda-
tion engine for an online learning platform.
10.1 High-Level Description
• The system recommends courses and learning materials to students based
on their past activity , preferences, and performance.
• It is integrated into the main platform and runs on real user data.
10.2 Sample Requirements
F unctional
• FR1: The system shall generate a list of at least 5 recommended courses
for each active user each day .
• FR2: The system shall update recommendations after users complete a
course.
• FR3: The system shall provide an explanation (e.g. “Because you com-
pleted Course X”) for each recommendation.
Non-functional (Using FURPS+)
• F unctionality:
– Must support course recommendations for undergraduate, postgrad-
uate, and professional courses.
– Must filter out courses that are not available in the user’s region.
• Usability:
– Recommendations shall be displayed in a dedicated “Recommended
for Y ou” section on the dashboard.
– Users shall be able to hide or dismiss recommendations they find
irrelevant.
• Reliability:
– The recommendations service shall have an availability of at least
99%.
– If the AI model fails, the system shall fall back to a simple popular-
ity‑based recommendation.
• Performance:
– Generating recommendations for a single user shall take no more than
500 ms on average under normal load.
– The system shall handle up to 10,000 recommendation requests per
minute.
• Supportability:
– It shall be possible to deploy updated models without downtime.
– The system shall log model versions used for each recommendation
for later analysis.
• – (Legal / Ethics / Interfaces):
14– The system shall comply with privacy regulations and allow users to
opt out of personalised recommendations.
– The system shall expose an internal API for retrieving recommenda-
tions from other platform components.
10.3 MoSCoW Prioritisation Example
F or the first release:
• Must have
– Daily recommendations (FR1).
– Basic explanations for recommendations (FR3).
– Privacy compliance and opt‑out options.
– Performance requirement of max 500 ms per recommendation under
normal load.
• Should have
– Real‑time updates after course completion (FR2).
– Logging of model versions.
• Could have
– Advanced explanations (e.g. feature contributions, visualisations).
– User ability to give feedback (like/dislike) on recommendations.
• W on’t have (this time)
– Cross‑platform recommendations across multiple partner universi-
ties.
– Complex fairness constraints for specific research studies (planned
for a future release).
11. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
11.1 Common Pitfalls
• V ague requirements:
– “F ast”, “user‑friendly”, “secure” without measurable criteria.
• Hidden assumptions :
– Assuming users have high‑speed internet, or that all data is clean.
• Missing stakeholders :
– Ignoring support teams, operations, or regulators.
• Over‑engineering:
– Adding many “Could have” features as “Must have” without justifi-
cation.
• Poor traceability :
– Hard to know which code and tests implement a given requirement.
11.2 Best Practices
• Use structured templates for requirements (e.g. “The system shall …”).
15• Combine multiple elicitation techniques to get a more complete pic-
ture.
• Regularly perform reviews and walkthroughs with stakeholders.
• Use FURPS+ as a checklist for non‑functional requirements and con-
straints.
• Use MoSCoW (or a similar scheme) to prioritise requirements explicitly .
• Maintain traceability between requirements, design, implementation,
and tests.
• Keep requirements up to date as changes are agreed.
12. Activities
T ry the following activities to apply what you have learned.
Activity 1: Identify Requirements for a Simple System
Choose a simple system, for example:
• A mobile task management app.
• A campus room booking system.
• A simple chatbot for answering F AQs.
T asks:
1. Identify at least 8–10 functional requirements.
2. Identify at least 6–8 non‑functional requirements.
3. Classify the non‑functional requirements using FURPS+.
4. Prioritise all requirements using MoSCoW.
Activity 2: Rewrite Ambiguous Requirements
Given the following vague requirements, rewrite them to be clearer and testable:
1. “The system should be easy to use. ”
2. “The system must be secure. ”
3. “Reports should be generated quickly . ”
F or each, specify:
• Measurable criteria.
• Relevant FURPS+ category .
Activity 3: Simple Use Case and User Stories
F or the same system you chose in Activity 1:
1. W rite one detailed use case (name, actor, goal, main flow).
2. Derive at least three user stories from this use case, each with acceptance
criteria.
