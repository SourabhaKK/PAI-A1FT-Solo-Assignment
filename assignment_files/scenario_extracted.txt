Assessment Scenario 
 
Scenario for Task 2 – Supermarket Dataset 
You have been contracted by a supermarket chain to design a Python -based data structure 
and algorithm to analyse customer purchasing patterns  from their transaction records. The 
dataset you are provided with contains thousands of market basket transactions, where 
each transaction is a list of items purchased together by a customer during a single shopping 
visit. 
The supermarket is interested in  efficiently answering queries such as:  
 “Which items are most frequently bought together with bread?”  
 “What are the top three most common product bundles across all transactions?”  
 “How can we quickly identify whether two items are often co -purchased?” 
To support these requirements, your task is to:  
1. Data Structure Design 
o Choose an appropriate data structure to model the supermarket transactions 
as a network of items. For example, you might  choose to represent the items 
and their co-occurrences using a graph, where: 
 Each node represents a grocery item (e.g., bread, milk, eggs).  
 An edge between two nodes represents that the items were bought 
together, with edge weights indicating frequency.  
o This structure must allow efficient queries such as finding item associ ations, 
updating the network with new transactions, and retrieving frequent co -
purchases. 
2. Algorithm Implementation 
o Implement an algorithm to process the dataset into your chosen structure.  
o Then implement one or more algorithms that operate on the structure , for 
example: 
 Graph traversal/search (e.g., BFS/DFS) to identify related items.  
 Frequent pair/itemset mining  
 Sorting and ranking algorithms  to identify the top product bundles.  
3. Application-Specific Requirements and Extensions  
o Visualise the item relationship graph, highlighting the strongest associations.  
o Use filters to focus on certain items/itemsets  
o Or implement a recommendation -style query: given an item (or itemset), 
return the top items likely to be bought with it.  
This scenario reflects a real-world market basket analysis  use case, widely applied in online 
and offline retail for product placement, promotions, and recommendation systems . Your

implementation should focus on efficient data structures and algorithms rather than on 
external machine learning libraries. To answer this question (Task2)  you must only use the 
data structures and algorithms that you learnt during this module (not other methods which 
might be out of the scope of this module; if you are not sure, you can double -check with 
your module tutors.)
